# LightsOut App: Product Design Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 07, 2026  
**Authors:** Conceptualized in collaboration with xAI Grok  
**Status:** Draft  

## Executive Summary

LightsOut is a innovative mobile application designed to enhance productivity, focus, and sleep quality by enforcing structured "lock-in" periods where users commit to distraction-free modes. The app simulates a "lights out" state on the device, dimming screens, blocking notifications, and restricting access to non-essential features. Key differentiators include a 20% override rule to build discipline, customizable modes for work/study (Focus Mode) and bedtime (Sleep Mode), and deep integrations with device hardware and software layers for an immersive experience. Targeted at users seeking digital wellness, the app combines empathy-driven nudges with robust enforcement to foster sustainable habits.

Built for iOS and Android, LightsOut adopts a freemium model with premium features unlocking advanced analytics and customizations. This document outlines the app's concept, features, user experience, technical implementation, monetization strategy, challenges, and development roadmap.

## 1. Introduction and Core Concept

### 1.1 App Overview
LightsOut empowers users to "lock in" during work or study sessions and "lights out" for restful sleep by temporarily transforming their phone into a minimalistic, distraction-free device. The app addresses common pain points like endless scrolling, notification overload, and poor sleep hygiene, promoting mental health and efficiency.

- **Primary Goals**:
  - Boost productivity through enforced focus periods.
  - Improve sleep by automating wind-down routines and device restrictions.
  - Build long-term habits via gentle friction (e.g., timed overrides) and data-driven insights.

- **Target Audience**:
  - Professionals and students (focus modes).
  - Individuals with sleep issues (e.g., insomniacs, shift workers).
  - Wellness enthusiasts integrating with smart homes or wearables.

- **Unique Selling Points (USPs)**:
  - **20% Override Rule**: Users must complete at least 20% of a session before accessing custom override commands, reducing impulse quits.
  - **Holistic Integration**: Combines screen dimming, sensor disabling, and network isolation for a "true blackout" feel.
  - **Cross-Mode Versatility**: Seamless switch between focus and sleep, with AI-suggested schedules based on user data.

### 1.2 Inspiration and Market Fit
Drawing from apps like Forest (gamified focus) and Calm (sleep aids), LightsOut stands out by merging both into one tool with stricter enforcement. Market research indicates a growing demand for digital detox apps, with the global wellness app market projected to reach $15 billion by 2028. Competitors like Focus@Will or Screen Time lack the hardware-level immersion and override safeguards.

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1 Modes of Operation
- **Focus Mode (Lock-In)**:
  - Timer-based sessions (e.g., 25-90 minutes, customizable presets inspired by Pomodoro).
  - Actions: Dim screen to grayscale/low brightness; block non-whitelisted apps; silence notifications (except emergencies); play ambient sounds or display motivational overlays.
  - Enhancements: Integration with task managers (e.g., Todoist) to link sessions to specific goals.

- **Sleep Mode (Nighttime LightsOut)**:
  - Scheduled activation (e.g., 10 PM to 6 AM, recurring).
  - Actions: Full screen blackout; enable Do Not Disturb; gradual wind-down (dim lights, play lullabies 15-30 minutes prior); track sleep via device sensors or wearables.
  - Post-session: Morning reports on sleep duration and quality, with tips for improvement.

### 2.2 Timer and Scheduling
- **Setup Options**: Quick timers, custom durations, recurring schedules (daily/weekly).
- **20% Rule Enforcement**: Overrides locked until 20% elapsed (e.g., 12 minutes into a 1-hour session). Post-20%, nudges like "Confirm exit? Progress so far: 25%" appear.
- **Emergency Handling**: Instant exits via hardware triggers (e.g., double power button press), logged for habit analysis.

### 2.3 Customization and Overrides
- **Custom Commands**: Voice/gesture-based (e.g., "LightsOut pause" via Siri/Google Assistant), but time-locked.
- **Whitelists/Blacklists**: User-defined app access (e.g., allow Spotify for focus, block all social media).
- **Profiles**: Pre-built themes like "Strict Work" (no overrides) or "Relaxed Sleep" (gradual enforcement).

### 2.4 Integrations
- **Device Sync**: Cross-platform (iOS/Android) with desktop web extension for browser blocking.
- **Smart Home**: Link to Philips Hue or Google Home to dim physical lights.
- **Health Ecosystems**: Sync with Apple Health/Google Fit for circadian-based suggestions; wearables for accurate sleep tracking.
- **Social Features**: Optional accountability sharing (e.g., auto-messages to contacts: "In LightsOut until 2 PM").

### 2.5 Analytics and Insights
- Track streaks, override frequency, and session completion rates.
- AI-driven recommendations (e.g., "Shorten focus sessions to reduce overrides").
- Premium: Detailed graphs on sleep/focus trends.

## 3. User Experience (UX/UI)

### 3.1 Onboarding and Interface
- **Onboarding Flow**: Goal-setting quiz (e.g., "Focus or sleep?"), permission requests with explanations, guided first session.
- **Design Principles**: Minimalist, dark-mode default with calming palettes (blues, grays). Intuitive navigation via bottom tabs: Home, Schedules, Profiles, Insights.
- **Home Screen**: Displays upcoming sessions, current streaks, and quick-start buttons.

### 3.2 During Sessions
- **Visuals**: Serene lock screens (e.g., starry night for sleep, zen motifs for focus) with countdown timers and breathing widgets.
- **Interactivity**: Minimal—taps reveal progress but no full unlocks until 20% threshold.

### 3.3 Post-Session
- **Feedback Loop**: Quick surveys for refinement; celebratory badges for completions.
- **Accessibility**: VoiceOver support, high-contrast modes, customizable font sizes.

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Overview
- **Framework**: Cross-platform with React Native/Flutter for UI; native modules for low-level access.
- **State Management**: Finite State Machine (FSM) for modes; persistent storage via SharedPreferences/Keychain.
- **Background Operations**: Android Foreground Services/iOS Background Modes for enforcement.

### 4.2 Screen and Display Control
- Dim to 0% brightness with black overlays.
- Android: `WindowManager` flags for screen off; iOS: Guided Access integration.

### 4.3 Sensor and Hardware Management
- **Sensors**: Unregister listeners (e.g., `SensorManager` on Android, `CMMotionManager` on iOS) to halt data from accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.
- **Location/Camera/Microphone**: Dynamic permission revocation; accessibility overlays for blocking.
- **Haptics**: Suppress via API cancellations.

### 4.4 Network and Isolation
- Simulate Airplane Mode: Toggle WiFi/Bluetooth (Android APIs; iOS prompts).
- App Blocking: Suspend backgrounds via `UsageStatsManager` (Android); DND APIs both platforms.

### 4.5 Power Optimization
- Enable low-power modes; minimal polling (5-10 seconds).
- Battery Impact: Target <5% drain per hour.

### 4.6 Security and Compliance
- Encrypted data storage; opt-in cloud sync.
- Avoid root/jailbreak; transparent permissions.

## 5. Monetization and Business Model

- **Freemium Structure**: Free core modes; premium ($4.99/month or $49.99/year) for unlimited profiles, analytics, custom audio, ad-free.
- **Partnerships**: Integrate with wellness apps (e.g., Calm) for affiliate revenue.
- **Additional Revenue**: In-app purchases for themes/sounds; enterprise version for corporate wellness programs.

## 6. Challenges and Solutions

- **User Frustration with Locks**: Solution: "Training Wheels" mode with easier overrides; educational tooltips.
- **OS Restrictions**: Fallback to soft locks (e.g., notifications only) if permissions denied.
- **Battery/Performance**: Optimize with efficient code; user education on benefits.
- **Competition**: Differentiate via unique 20% rule and hardware integrations.
- **Accessibility/Privacy**: Full compliance testing; anonymized data.
